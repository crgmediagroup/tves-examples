# tves-examples
TVEScripts for TVEngine made by me and the community. All of these are open-source TVEngine Scripts that can be used as examples. ANYTHING in the basic-demos folder is free to use without credit and is public domain, so that developers can get a "starter template" if you will.

## .tvhx and .tvcm
Support for these is not programmed in yet, and as such these files will not be uploaded to examples, as these are supposed to be open source. In future, a package manager built into TVEngine will be used to download TextVentures to run.

## License
basic-demos folder - Unlicense/Public Domain
everything else - GNU 3.0
